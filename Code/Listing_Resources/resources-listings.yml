# Filter/search behavior with the ejs file:
#   - Filter by two categories: 1. institution, 2. content type, 3. event type,
#     and 4. semester
#   - Sort tiles by "title" and "date-updated". The user can
#     control how these two characteristics are sorted.
#   - Default sorting of the tiles is by "ranking" (ascending) then "title"
#     (A-Z)
# 
# 
# When adding new tiles:
#   - Under "items" each entry requires association with both categories
#     and metadata that gets added under "tiles" |-> "- title: ** ".
#   - Group tiles with the SAME four categories together under the same "tiles".
#     This causes all tiles listed under that subsection to get filtered together
#     when the user selectes any or both categories.
#   - Mandatory "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "title", "description", 
#     "date-added", "date-updated", "ranking," "image", "topic" to list the 
#     second category.


#   - Opional "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "site" for the main webpage for

          Today’s Internet-scale applications and cloud services generate massive amounts of data. At the same time, the availability of inexpensive storage has made it possible for these services and applications to collect and store every piece of data they generate, in the hopes of improving their services by analyzing the collected data. This introduces interesting new opportunities and challenges designing systems for collecting, analyzing, and serving the so-called big data. This course looks at technology trends that have paved the way for big data applications, surveys state-of-the-art systems for storage and processing of big data, and considers future research directions driven by open research problems. Our discussions span topics such as cluster architecture, big data analytics stacks, scheduling and resource management, batch and stream analytics, graph processing, ML/AI frameworks, and serverless platforms and disaggregated architectures.

        description: |
          In recent years, deep learning has seen applications in many fields, from science and technology, to finance, humanity, and businesses. However, real-world, high-impact machine learning applications demand more than just model performance. In particular, deep learning models are often required to be “trustworthy,” so that domain experts can trust that the models consistently behave in a way that corresponds to their domain knowledge. For example, medical experts would expect a deep learning diagnosis model to be able to explicitly utilize medical domain knowledge in its prediction; an insurance company would expect a decision on insurance price to be explainable in terms of risk factors; a financial company would expect its fraud detection model to be robust to adversarial attacks; a physicist would expect models to provide consistency with the underlying laws. This course introduces various fields of trustworthy deep learning, including model robustness, defenses for adversarial attacks, interpretability, explainability, fairness, privacy, domain adaptation, rules, and constraints. The course covers some of these aspects in the context of graph neural networks but also covers many other ML models in general deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

        description: |
          This course focuses on fundamental topics in machine learning. We begin with an overview of different components of machine learning and types of learning paradigms. We introduce a linear function, discuss how one can train a linear function on a given dataset, and utilize it to tackle classification and regression problems. We then consider kernel methods to enable us to solve nonlinear problems. Additionally, we introduce the concept of generalization error and overfitting. We discuss the role of regularization and extend linear regression to ridge regression. We also cover topics in optimization, beginning from gradient descent and extending it to stochastic gradient descent and its momentum variant. We also cover the concept of alternating optimization and topics within it. We introduce the curse of dimensionality and discuss topics on dimensionality reduction. Finally, we conclude the course with neural networks: how to build them using the topics discussed, how to optimize them, and how to apply them to solve a range of machine learning tasks.

          Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer tremendous promise to improve the care of patients. However, few ML applications are currently deployed within healthcare institutions and even fewer provide real value. This course is designed to empower students to overcome common pitfalls in bringing ML to the bedside and aims to provide a holistic approach to the complexities and nuances of ML in the healthcare space. The class focuses on key steps of model development and implementation centered on real-world applications. Students apply what they learn from the lectures, assignments, and readings to identify salient healthcare problems and tackle their solutions through end-to-end data engineering pipelines.
          </br>
          </br>
          Students are expected to be proficient in programming (R, Python, or Julia preferred) and have some prior experience in machine learning including data preprocessing (e.g., Python-Pandas, R- Tidyverse) and the development and validation of ML models (e.g. logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost). Otherwise, permission of the instructor is required.

        description: |
          This course provides an overview of statistical and analytical methods that apply specifically to infectious diseases. The assumption of independent outcomes among individuals that underlies most traditional statistical methods often does not apply to infections that can be transmitted from person to person. Therefore, novel methods are often needed to address the unique challenges posed by infectious disease data. Topics include analysis of outbreak data, estimation of vaccine efficacy, time series methods, and Markov models. The course consists of lectures and computer labs in which students gain experience analyzing example problems using a flexible computer programming language (MATLAB).

        description: |
          With the explosion of conversational generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Claude Sonnet, DeepSeek, and many others, innovations in data science are greatly influencing day-to-day decision making of the public including decision regarding health, well-being, prevention, treatment and care. This new course  thematically belongs to the intersectional field of critical data studies, data science, and public health. Critical data studies is an interdisciplinary field focused on the social, cultural, ethical, and epistemological aspects of data. We first define some of the fundamental technical terms and tools in modern data science, machine learning (ML), and AI such as random forest, neural networks, transformer, auto-encoder, embeddings, stable diffusion process, large language models/foundation models, reinforcement learning, and prediction-powered inference. We then introduce the notion of data equity and data ethics in broad philosophical terms, held by a theoretical framework that appeals to a set of key underlying principles, drawing primarily from the extant computer science and statistical/epidemiological literature. We introduce these core concepts and associated evaluation metrics. The discussed concepts include: fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics, privacy, governance, reflexivity, reproducibility, generalizability, representativeness, causality, confounding bias, selection bias, and information bias. The course consists of lectures, homework, paper presentations, discussion sessions, and a final project that involves critical appraisal of an open-source AI/data science tool or prediction model in terms of the principles taught in the course.
