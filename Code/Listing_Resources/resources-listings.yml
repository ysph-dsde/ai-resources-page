# Filter/search behavior with the ejs file:
#   - Filter by two categories: 1. affiliation, 2. content type, 3. event type,
#     and 4. semester
#   - Sort tiles by "title" and "date-updated". The user can
#     control how these two characteristics are sorted.
#   - Default sorting of the tiles is by "ranking" (ascending) then "title"
#     (A-Z)
# 
# 
# When adding new tiles:
#   - Under "items" each entry requires association with both categories
#     and metadata that gets added under "tiles" |-> "- title: ** ".
#   - Group tiles with the SAME four categories together under the same "tiles".
#     This causes all tiles listed under that subsection to get filtered together
#     when the user selectes any or both categories.
#   - Mandatory "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "title", "description", 
#     "date-added", "date-updated", "ranking," "image", "topic" to list the 
#     second category.


#   - Opional "tiles" |-> "- title: ** " fields: "site" for the main webpage for 
#     the source, "group" for the lab or group webpage who provides the source,
#     "github" for the codebase repository, "article" if there primary articles
#     presenting the resource by the creators, and "info" that links to an
#     internal page with additional details about the resource.
# 
# When editing existing tiles:
#   - Ensure that the new links work as expected.
#   - Change the "date-updated" entry for the tile you edited.
#   - Change the "last updated" sections at the top of the page.

        description: |
          This course covers many popular topics in machine learning and statistics that are widely used for the exploration of biomedical data. Techniques covered include different linear prediction methods, random forest, boosting, neural networks, and some recent progress on model inference in high dimensions, as well as dimension reduction and clustering. Various examples using biomedical data—e.g., microarray gene expression data, single-cell RNA-Seq data—are provided. The emphasis is on the statistical aspects of different machine-learning methods and their applications to problems in computational biology.

        description: |
          With the explosion of conversational generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Claude Sonnet, DeepSeek, and many others, innovations in data science are greatly influencing day-to-day decision making of the public including decision regarding health, well-being, prevention, treatment and care. This new course  thematically belongs to the intersectional field of critical data studies, data science, and public health. Critical data studies is an interdisciplinary field focused on the social, cultural, ethical, and epistemological aspects of data. We first define some of the fundamental technical terms and tools in modern data science, machine learning (ML), and AI such as random forest, neural networks, transformer, auto-encoder, embeddings, stable diffusion process, large language models/foundation models, reinforcement learning, and prediction-powered inference. We then introduce the notion of data equity and data ethics in broad philosophical terms, held by a theoretical framework that appeals to a set of key underlying principles, drawing primarily from the extant computer science and statistical/epidemiological literature. We introduce these core concepts and associated evaluation metrics. The discussed concepts include: fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics, privacy, governance, reflexivity, reproducibility, generalizability, representativeness, causality, confounding bias, selection bias, and information bias. The course consists of lectures, homework, paper presentations, discussion sessions, and a final project that involves critical appraisal of an open-source AI/data science tool or prediction model in terms of the principles taught in the course.

      - title: "BIS 568: Applied Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare"
        description: |
          Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer tremendous promise to improve the care of patients. However, few ML applications are currently deployed within healthcare institutions and even fewer provide real value. This course is designed to empower students to overcome common pitfalls in bringing ML to the bedside and aims to provide a holistic approach to the complexities and nuances of ML in the healthcare space. The class focuses on key steps of model development and implementation centered on real-world applications. Students apply what they learn from the lectures, assignments, and readings to identify salient healthcare problems and tackle their solutions through end-to-end data engineering pipelines.
          </br>
          </br>
          Students are expected to be proficient in programming (R, Python, or Julia preferred) and have some prior experience in machine learning including data preprocessing (e.g., Python-Pandas, R- Tidyverse) and the development and validation of ML models (e.g. logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost). Otherwise, permission of the instructor is required.

          Yale University, in partnership with <a href="https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/">Boehringer Ingelheim</a>, one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies, launched in 2021 a Biomedical Data Science Fellowship program designed to attract and support some of the brightest and most innovative minds in data science from around the world.
          </br>
          </br>
          The program has successfully offered ten competitive fellowships during its initial phase and will expand by recruiting three new fellows in 2025 and two in 2026. Post-doctoral researchers awarded a three-year fellowship will have access to Yale’s world class faculty, cutting edge research programs, various biomedical data repositories, and robust computational resources. Applicants with strong biomedical data science background and research experience are invited to submit research proposals for consideration. If approved for a fellowship, they will be jointly mentored throughout the research process by Yale’s faculty and scientists from Boehringer Ingelheim. In addition to receiving research funding and mentorship, program fellows will be invited to participate in campus and corporate visits, networking events, and annual symposia.
          </br>
          </br>
          The program leverages the expertise of faculty and research members representing diverse disciplines from computational biology, bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, statistics, biostatistics, computer science, mathematics, biomedical engineering, systems biology, precision medicine, and public health informatics.

          Today’s Internet-scale applications and cloud services generate massive amounts of data. At the same time, the availability of inexpensive storage has made it possible for these services and applications to collect and store every piece of data they generate, in the hopes of improving their services by analyzing the collected data. This introduces interesting new opportunities and challenges designing systems for collecting, analyzing, and serving the so-called big data. This course looks at technology trends that have paved the way for big data applications, surveys state-of-the-art systems for storage and processing of big data, and considers future research directions driven by open research problems. Our discussions span topics such as cluster architecture, big data analytics stacks, scheduling and resource management, batch and stream analytics, graph processing, ML/AI frameworks, and serverless platforms and disaggregated architectures.
